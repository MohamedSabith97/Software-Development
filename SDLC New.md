>## **Software Development Life Cycle**
 
  Streamlined Development relies on two things one is reliable methodology, and second one is detailed process from getting from point a to point b.


**_Defining SDLC_**

>A systematic approach that generates a structure for the developer to design, create and deliver high quality software based on customer requirements and needs. The primary goalof the SDLC process is product cost efficeintand high quality products. The process comprises a detailed plan that describes how to develop, maintain, and replace the software.

_The Phases of Software Developement is following as below :_

* Project Planning
* Gathering Requirement
* Designing
* Coding and Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance

>**Project Planning** :

The first stage of SDLC is all about "What do we want?" Project plan is vital role in the software delivery lifecycle since this is the part where the team estimates the cost and defines the requirements of the new software.

>**Gathering Requirements**

Gatherig maximum information from the client requirements for the product. Discuss each detail and specification of the product with the customer. The development team will then analyze the requirements keeping the design and code of the software in mind. Further, investigating the validity and possibility of incorporating these requirements into the software system. The main goal of this stage is that everyone understands even the minute detail of the requirement. Hardware, operating systems, programming, and security are to name the few requirements.

>**Designing**

In the design phase, the program developer scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end user. Additionally, if the project is feasible for the customer technologically, practically, and financially. Once the developer decides on the best design approach, he then selects the program languages like oracle, java. that will suit the software.

Once the design specification is prepared, all the stakeholders will review this plan and provide their feedback and suggestions. It absolutely mandatory to collect and incorporate stakeholdes's input in the documents,  as a small mistake can lead to cost overrun.

>**Coding and Implementations**

Time to code it means translating the design to a computer legible language. in this fourth stage of SDLC, the tasks are divided int various developers. the developers will then start building the entire system by writing code usingthe programming languages they chose.
this stage is considered to be one of the longest in SDLC. The developers need certain predefined coding guidelines,and programming tools like interpreters, compilers, debugger to implement the code.

The developers can show the work done to the business analysts in case if any modifications or enhancements required.

>**Testing**

Once the developers build the software, then it deployed in the testing environment. then the testing teamtests the functionality of the entire system. in this fifth of SDLC, the testing is done to ensure thatthe entire application works according to the customer requirements.

After the testing, the QA and testing team might find some bugs or efects and communicate the same with the developers. The development team then fixes the bugs and send it to QA for a re-test. This process goes on until the software is stable, bug-free and working according to the business requirements of the system.

>**Deployment**

The sixth phase of SDlc : Once the testing is done, and the product is ready for deployment, it is released for customers to use. The size of the project determies the complexity of the deployment. The users are then provided with the training or documentation that will help them to operate the software. Again, a small round of testing is performed on production to ensure environmental issues or any impact of the new release.

>**Maintenance**

The actual problem starts when the customer actually starts using the developed system and those needs to be solved from time to time. Maintenance is the seventh phase of SDLC where the developed product is taken care of. According to the changing user end environment or technology, the software is updated timely.
